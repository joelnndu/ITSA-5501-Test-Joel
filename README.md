# ITSA-5501 Test Project

**Name:** Joel Ndu  
**Student ID:** N01746404 

This repository was created as part of the ITSA-5501 test.  
It contains the initial project structure, including index.js, .gitignore, and supporting files.  
The purpose of this test is to demonstrate Git initialization, repository setup, and pushing code to GitHub.

## GitHub Actions Workflow

I have configured a GitHub Actions workflow named "DevOps Test".  
It runs automatically when I push changes to the main or master branch.  
The workflow checks out the repository code and runs a simple echo command to confirm the workflow executed successfully.
